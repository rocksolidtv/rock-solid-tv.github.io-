            <img src="rock_solid_tv_about_image.jpg" alt="Rocky Smith - Rock Solid TV" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; border:3px solid #f00; margin-bottom:20px;">
            <p>Welcome to Rock Solid TV — where truth doesn’t ask for permission.</p>
            <p>This isn’t your average YouTube channel. This is <strong>uncensored history</strong>, <strong>unfiltered truth</strong>, and <strong>unshakable faith</strong> carved in stone. Founded by <strong>Rocky Smith</strong>, a Bible-believing truther from West Tennessee with a fire in his bones and a mic in his hand, Rock Solid TV digs where others won’t, asks what others fear, and says what others silence.</p>
            <p>Raised in a strong, Bible-based Christian home, Rocky memorized entire chapters of the King James Bible before most kids knew their multiplication tables. At age <strong>7</strong>, he wrote his own sermon, recorded it on cassette, and handed it to his grandfather — a local AM radio preacher. That sermon aired for years. Why? Because even at seven, Rocky wasn’t playing church.</p>
            <p>He’s a <strong>25-year survivor</strong> of leukemia and a <strong>bone marrow transplant warrior</strong>. When the doctors wrote him off, God wrote him back in. Psalm 118:17 became his war cry: <em>“I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.”</em></p>
            <p>That’s what this channel is — <strong>declaration</strong>. Not of opinions. Of facts, Scripture, and hard truths they buried deep.</p>
            <p>We expose:<br>
            - The lies they taught in school<br>
            - The prophecies the church ignores<br>
            - The elite’s playbook and satanic agenda<br>
            - And the <strong>true remnant’s call</strong> to stand, fight, and never bow.</p>
            <p>Rock Solid TV isn’t here to win applause. It’s here to <strong>wake the lions</strong>, <strong>warn the sheep</strong>, and <strong>wreck the wolves</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you’re tired of soft sermons, fake history, and spiritual sedation — welcome home.</p>
            <p>This is Rock Solid TV. Let’s shake the gates of hell.</p>
