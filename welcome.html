    <h1>Welcome to the Unfiltered Side</h1>
    <p>This blog is where the gloves come off. No algorithms to dodge. No censors to please.</p>
    <p>Here, you’ll get inside thoughts, project updates, deep dives, and maybe a few rants straight from Rocky Smith himself.</p>
    <p>Stay bold, stay awake — and keep digging for truth.</p>
